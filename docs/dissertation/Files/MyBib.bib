abstract = {Sir James Lighthill proposed a method for estimating the hydrodynamic forces generated by slender fish, and his analysis made clear the mechanism of fish swimming. His method is based on slender body theory, and the hydrodynamic forces produced by fish are explained by their kinematics and the added mass of the body sections. More recently, numerical techniques for estimating hydrodynamic forces are making progress, but Lighthill's method is still very important and useful because it contributes to our understanding of the physics of fish swimming. We propose a new method for estimating the aerodynamic forces generated by flapping wings: the forces are explained by the added mass of vortex wake sheets. In concept, it is similar to the momentum theory for fixed wings, which was developed by Prandtl. So, when the forward velocity is large, the method agrees with the momentum theory for a fixed wing. For hovering flight, where vortex sheets are generated continuously, this method agrees with the Rankine–Froude momentum theory of propellers. Like Lighthill's method for swimming, this newly developed method provides useful insight into the physics of flapping wings.},

Model validation module uses NuSMV, which is one of Model Checking tools, to check whether the system can continue its mission toward the goal in the given environment.

abstract = {In the past decade, research into insect-inspired flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (FWMAV) has grown steadily, toward addressing unique challenges in morphological construction, force production, and control strategy. Remarkable results have emerged from work focused on generation of adequate lift force for levitation and vertical acceleration [1]; however, effective methods for motion control still remain an open problem. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a novel approach to FWMAV control problem that provides smooth, stable and independent flight in both vertical and horizontal maneuvers. Our insect-inspired MAV model employs a passive structure to adjust the angle of attack (AoA) of its wings. Further analysis of this design unveils its capability in creating significant amounts of net drag force without disturbing lift production. This is the foundation of 'tunable impedance' technique that allows us to independently control three basic motions. One controller regulates yaw and forward acceleration, utilizing intuitive PM control laws in order to control horizontal maneuvers. Lift force and corresponding vertical elevation changes are controlled by a second controller that modifies the frequency of a constant-amplitude, sinusoidal power stroke. A third controller stabilizes the vehicle's body pitch angle through biasing stroke angle of its wings, hence rejecting disturbances caused by fluctuations in the position of center of mass (CoM). Results of simulated experiments confirm that these three controllers together demonstrate exceptional ability in handling hovering or agile flight maneuvers - even in presence of moderate measurement noise. These results also suggest that employment of passive dynamics in the design of MAVs may not only reduce actuator bandwidth requirements - thus simplifying practical implementation of the vehicle - but also improve robustness to uncertainties in sensing and body morphology.},

A genetic algorithm for assigning the multiple agents to perform multiple tasks on multiple targets is proposed. The algorithm allows efficiently solving this NP-hard problem that has prohibitive computational complexity for classical combinatorial optimization methods. It also allows taking into account the unique requirements of the scenario such as task precedence and coordination, timing constraints, and flyable trajectories. The performance of the algorithm is compared to that of deterministic branch and bound search and stochastic random search methods. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the viability of the genetic algorithm, providing good feasible solutions quickly. Moreover, it converges near to the optimal solution considerably faster than the other methods for some test cases. This makes real-time implementation for high dimensional problems feasible.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design, analysis, and characterization of a compliant thoracic mechanism that saves inertial power for flapping-wing micro air vehicles. Lightweight polyimide film hinges were previously integrated into a compliant flapping-wing mechanism to reduce friction. However, these were not stiff enough to fully recover wing's inertial energy into elastic energy. To store adequate elastic energy using film hinges, we develop a compliant thoracic mechanism with nonlinear stiffness characteristics by mimicking a Dipteran insect's flight thorax. This thoracic mechanism consists of rigid plates and polyimide film hinges connected to form a closed shell structure. It has a nonlinearly increasing stiffness so that it can slow the wings down rapidly toward the end stroke and subsequently help reverse the wings. It demonstrates almost full recovery of inertial power for 10-cm span flapping wings up to 25 Hz. As a result, it only expends 2{\%} of the total mechanical power on inertial power at 25 Hz. In contrast, the rigid-body mechanism with no elastic storage expends 23{\%} of the total mechanical power on inertial power when the same wings beat at the same frequency. With the capability of elastic energy storage, this compliant thoracic mechanism saves power expenditure ranging from 20 up to 30{\%} to produce the same thrust, in comparison with the rigid-body flapping mechanism. This study shows that power saving is effective only if elastic energy storage is well tuned to recover the wing inertial power.},

abstract = {Here we provide the first formal quantitative analysis of dynamic stability in a flying animal. By measuring the longitudinal static stability derivatives and mass distribution of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria, we find that their static stability and static control responses are insufficient to provide asymptotic longitudinal dynamic stability unless they are sensitive to pitch attitude (measured with respect to an inertial or earth-fixed frame) as well as aerodynamic incidence (measured relative to the direction of flight). We find no evidence for a 'constant-lift reaction', previously supposed to keep lift production constant over a range of body angles, and show that such a reaction would be inconsequential because locusts can potentially correct for pitch disturbances within a single wingbeat. The static stability derivatives identify three natural longitudinal modes of motion: one stable subsidence mode, one unstable divergence mode, and one stable oscillatory mode (which is present with or without pitch attitude control). The latter is identified with the short period mode of aircraft, and shown to consist of rapid pitch oscillations with negligible changes in forward speed. The frequency of the short period mode (approx. 10 Hz) is only half the wingbeat frequency (approx. 22 Hz), so the mode would become coupled with the flapping cycle without adequate damping. Pitch rate damping is shown to be highly effective for this purpose - especially at the small scales associated with insect flight - and may be essential in stabilising locust flight. Although having a short period mode frequency close to the wingbeat frequency risks coupling, it is essential for control inputs made at the level of a single wingbeat to be effective. This is identified as a general constraint on flight control in flying animals.},

abstract = {Flapping wing flight has been extensively studied in the field of entomology, resulting in observations on the methods of lift production, high manoeuvrability and efficient flight for various natural flyers in differing flow regimes and leading to significant developments in biomimetic theories regarding flapping wing MAVs. In addition, advances in aerodynamic modelling methods have given insight into the un-steady 3-dimensional flow that characterises typical flapping wing flight. Therefore, before attempting to model a flapping wing MAV and analyse its stability, it is beneficial to consider previous studies carried out. The paper examines hover capable flapping wing flight as presented in previous work. The kinematics and aerodynamics seen in nature and the resulting control methods are explored. The paper additionally looks at existing modelling methods used to study the aerodynamics and overall vehicle behaviour of a hypothetical MAV with an aim to introduce the terminology and specifics of MAV flight, as well as give a brief description of the work done to date in flapping wing modelling. The paper ends by examining methods used to analyse stability of flapping wing models and demonstrates the suitability of bifurcation and continuation methods in determining stability behaviour of flapping wing flight dynamics models.},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

abstract = {Piezoelectric actuators have been used successfully to enable locomotion in aerial and ambulatory microrobotic platforms. However, the use of piezoelectric actuators presents two major challenges for power electronic design: generating high-voltage drive signals in systems typically powered by low-voltage energy sources, and recovering unused energy from the actuators. Due to these challenges, conventional drive circuits become too bulky or inefficient in low mass applications. This work describes electrical characteristics and drive requirements of low mass piezoelectric actuators, the design and optimization of suitable drive circuit topologies, aspects of the physical instantiation of these topologies, including the fabrication of extremely lightweight magnetic components, and a custom, ultra low power integrated circuit that implements control functionality for the drive circuits. The principles and building blocks presented here enable efficient high-voltage drive circuits that can satisfy the stringent weight and power requirements of microrobotic applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {State of the art approaches for visual-inertial sensor fusion use filter-based or optimization-based algorithms. Due to the nonlinearity of the system, a poor initialization can have a dramatic impact on the performance of these estimation methods. Recently, a closed-form solution providing such an initialization was derived in [1]. That solution determines the velocity (angular and linear) of a monocular camera in metric units by only using inertial measurements and image features acquired in a short time interval. In this paper, we study the impact of noisy sensors on the performance of this closed-form solution. We show that the gyroscope bias, not accounted for in [1], significantly affects the performance of the method. Therefore, we introduce a new method to automatically estimate this bias. Compared to the original method, the new approach now models the gyroscope bias and is robust to it. The performance of the proposed approach is successfully demonstrated on real data from a quadrotor MAV.},

All agents live in a lattice-like environment, with each agent fixed on a lattice-point. By this means, the speed of information passing among particles is optimized. Moreover, K -means clustering algorithm is introduced to form spatial distinct subpopulations. As a result of all the efforts, an effective way to plan multiple routes is found. Using it, an emulator is designed and some experiments are done. The results prove the feasibility and suitability of the novel method for multiple routes planning issue.},

abstract = {The transition of visual-odometry technology from research demonstrators to commercial applications naturally raises the question: “what is the optimal camera for vision- based motion estimation?” This question is crucial as the choice of camera has a tremendous impact on the robustness and accuracy of the employed visual odometry algorithm. While many properties of a camera (e.g. resolution, frame-rate, global- shutter/rolling-shutter) could be considered, in this work we focus on evaluating the impact of the camera field-of-view (FoV) and optics (i.e., fisheye or catadioptric) on the quality of the motion estimate. Since the motion-estimation performance depends highly on the geometry of the scene and the motion of the camera, we analyze two common operational environments in mobile robotics: an urban environment and an indoor scene. To confirm the theoretical observations, we implement a state- of-the-art VO pipeline that works with large FoV fisheye and catadioptric cameras. We evaluate the proposed VO pipeline in both synthetic and real experiments. The experiments point out that it is advantageous to use a large FoV camera (e.g., fisheye or catadioptric) for indoor scenes and a smaller FoV for urban canyon environments.},

abstract = {The UC Berkeley Micromechanical Flying Insect project entails the development of a micro air vehicle a little larger than a typical housefly which is capable of autonomous flight using flapping wings. There are numerous commercial and military applications which have been identified for such a flying microrobot. A functional, rather than morphological, biomimetic approach to mechanical design is taken so that the kinematic and dynamic wing motions of the robot will have the same qualitative aspects as those of a biological flying insect. Different manufacturing tools have been developed and employed to fabricate this robot and rapid prototyping techniques have allowed swift evolution of thorax models. Among these techniques, laser micromachining of templates and micro-origami to assemble these templates have been crucial to the thorax fabrication. Actuation is provided by single-crystal piezoelectric unimorphs with motion amplified through planar four-bar linkages. Work is also presented on the mechanical design of the flexures, thorax, and airframe. The first three-dimensional force map has been generated from a beating wing thorax at final scale and the data and compared to simulated forces. The results point out some important issues with regard to the actuator driving signals.},

abstract = {The flow structure that is largely responsible for the good performance of insect wings has recently been identified as a leading-edge vortex. But because such vortices become detached from a wing in two-dimensional flow, an unknown mechanism must keep them attached to (three-dimensional) flapping wings. The current explanation, analogous to a mechanism operating on delta-wing aircraft, is that spanwise flow through a spiral vortex drains energy from the vortex core. We have tested this hypothesis by systematically mapping the flow generated by a dynamically scaled model insect while simultaneously measuring the resulting aerodynamic forces. Here we report that, at the Reynolds numbers matching the flows relevant for most insects, flapping wings do not generate a spiral vortex akin to that produced by delta-wing aircraft. We also find that limiting spanwise flow with fences and edge baffles does not cause detachment of the leading-edge vortex. The data support an alternative hypothesis-that downward flow induced by tip vortices limits the growth of the leading-edge vortex.},

abstract = {In this work, we examine two design modifications to a tethered motor-driven flapping-wing system. Previously, we had demonstrated a simple mechanism utilizing a linear transmission for resonant operation and direct drive of the wing flapping angle for control. The initial two-wing system had a weight of 2.7 grams and a maximum lift-to-weight ratio of 1.4. While capable of vertical takeoff, in open-loop flight it demonstrated instability and pitch oscillations at the wing flapping frequency, leading to flight times of only a few wing strokes. Here the effect of vertical wing offset as well as an alternative multi-wing layout is investigated and experimentally tested with newly constructed prototypes. With only a change in vertical wing offset, stable open-loop flight of the two-wing flapping system is shown to be theoretically possible, but difficult to achieve with our current design and operating parameters. Both of the new two and four-wing systems, however, prove capable of flying to the end of the tether, with the four-wing system prototype eliminating disruptive wing beat oscillations.},

abstract = {Key to the success of the micromechanical flying insect project is developing sensors for flight force measurement. At the lowest level of MFI control is the wing control system which will rely on wing and thorax mounted force sensors. These sensors will have the dual function of stroke by stroke force characterization and system identification as well as use in feedback control for all levels. There are two methods for force sensing on a flying robotic insect, measurements directly on the thorax, and body force measurement with a tradeoff in design between sensor bandwidth and sensitivity.},

abstract = {This paper presents a wing characterization method for insect-scale flapping-wing robots. A quasi-steady model is developed to predict passive wing pitching at mid- stroke. Millimeter scale wings and passive hinges are manu- factured using the SCM fabrication processes. Flapping ex- periments at various frequencies and driving voltages are performed to extract kinematics for comparison with the quasi- steady predictions. These experiments examine the validity of the quasi-steady model and demonstrate the robustness of the wing characterization method. In addition, because time- averaged lift and drag are strongly correlated with flapping kinematics, quasi-steady prediction of wing kinematics directly leads to predictions of lift and drag generation. Given a flapping frequency and a driving voltage, the model computes the hinge stiffness that leads to optimal flapping kinematics. This reduces the number of flapping experiments required for wing characterization},

abstract = {It is anticipatedthat theMars ScienceLaboratory rover, namedCuriosity,will traverse 10–20 kmon the surface of Mars during its primary mission. In preparation for this traverse, Earth-based tests were performed using Mars weight vehicles. These vehicles were driven over Mars analog bedrock, cohesive soil, and cohesionless sand at various slopes. Vehicle slip was characterized on each of these terrains versus slope for direct upslope driving. Results show that slopes up to 22 degrees are traversable on smooth bedrock and that slopes up to 28 degrees are traversable on some cohesive soils. In cohesionless sand, results show a sharp transition between moderate slip on 10 degree slopes and vehicle embedding at 17 degrees. For cohesionless sand, data are also presented showing the relationship between vehicle slip and wheel sinkage. Side by side testing of the Mars Exploration Rover test vehicle and the Mars Science Laboratory test vehicle show how increased wheel diameter leads to better slope climbing ability in sand for vehicles with nearly identical ground pressure. Lastly, preliminary data from Curiosity's initial driving on Mars are presented and compared to the Earth-based testing, showing good agreement for the driving done during the first 250 Martian days.},

The simulation tool includes a quasi-static model of the piezoelectric actuator bending, transmission kinematics, and the small Reynolds number aerodynamic forces governing wing dynamics. To validate the developed tool, two single-wing systems with distinct resonant frequencies are manufactured and characterized. Comparison to experimental results reveals that, although discrepancies exist, the simulation is able to predict general trends of wing kinematics and lift behavior as functions of frequency, thus, being useful as a design tool. Finally, the complex models, ranging from actuator deflection to wing aerodynamics presented in this paper, allow analysis of the complete system revealing insight into several wing trajectory control methodologies, and potentially serving as a design and optimization tool for future flapping wing robots.},

In particular, we introduce the DelFly ‘Explorer', a 20-gram FWMAV equipped with a 0.98-gram autopilot and a 4.0-gram onboard stereo vision system. We explain the design choices that permit carrying the extended payload, while retaining the DelFly's hover capabilities. In addition, we introduce a novel stereo vision algorithm, LongSeq, designed specifically to cope with the flapping motion and the desire to attain a computational effort tuned to the frame rate. The onboard stereo vision system is illustrated in the context of an obstacle avoidance task in an environment with sparse obstacles.},

@article{Dickinson1996,
abstract = {We have used flow visualizations and instantaneous force measurements of tethered fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to study the dynamics of force generation during flight. During each complete stroke cycle, the flies generate one single vortex loop consisting of vorticity shed during the downstroke and ventral flip. This gross pattern of wake structure in Drosophila is similar to those described for hovering birds and some other insects. The wake structure differed from those previously described, however, in that the vortex filaments shed during ventral stroke reversal did not fuse to complete a circular ring, but rather attached temporarily to the body to complete an inverted heart-shaped vortex loop. The attached ventral filaments of the loop subsequently slide along the length of the body and eventually fuse at the tip of the abdomen. We found no evidence for the shedding of wing-tip vorticity during the upstroke, and argue that this is due to an extreme form of the Wagner effect acting at that time. The flow visualizations predicted that maximum flight forces would be generated during the downstroke and ventral reversal, with little or no force generated during the upstroke. The instantaneous force measurements using laser-interferometry verified the periodic nature of force generation. Within each stroke cycle, there was one plateau of high force generation followed by a period of low force, which roughly correlated with the upstroke and downstroke periods. However, the fluctuations in force lagged behind their expected occurrence within the wing-stroke cycle by approximately 1 ms or one-fifth of the complete stroke cycle. This temporal discrepancy exceeds the range of expected inaccuracies and artifacts in the measurements, and we tentatively discuss the potential retarding effects within the underlying fluid mechanics.},

However, emerging technologies such as micro air vehicles, and microrobotics in general, demand high force, high displacement, low mass actuators. Utilization of generic piezoceramics and high performance composite materials coupled with intelligent use of geometry and novel driving techniques yields low cost, rapidly prototyped, ultra-high energy density bending actuators for use in such applications. The design is based upon a laminate plate theory model for a stacked multimorph cantilever actuator, encompassing all possible layups, layer anisotropies, internal and external excitations, and intrinsic and extrinsic geometries. Using these principles, we have fabricated 12 mg PZT bimorph actuators with greater than 2 J kg−1 energy density. This gives a performance increase of an order of magnitude or greater compared to existing commercially available piezoelectric bending actuators.},

Lagrange's equations are employed to derive the geometrically nonlinear equations of motion. The Denavit-Hartenberg convention is used to model the wing flapping kinematics and the aerodynamic loads are represented using quasi-steady models of aerodynamics over each of the wing sections. The governing system is then cast in terms of a standard first order system with matched uncertainties that are due to the aerodynamic contributions. The closed loop control drives the system states such that they asymptotically track trajectories obtained from experimental observations of flapping wings of birds. Convergence and asymptotic stability of the tracking error closed loop dynamics is discussed. Finally, sufficient conditions are discussed under which the Lyapunov analysis guarantees identification of the aerodynamic loads, a topic of great interest to the research community investigating the aerodynamics of flapping flight.},

While these assumptions work well for high-quality, high-cost sensors, it does not work as well for low-cost, low-quality sensors. For low-cost sensors, complementary filters can be used since no assumptions are made with regards to linearity and noise statistics. In this paper, the concepts of filtering based on fractional-order calculus are applied to the complementary filter, and the efficacy of non-integer-order filtering on systems with non-gaussian noise is explored with good success.},

abstract = {In this study, we present a motor-driven flapping-wing actuator, designed to operate at its resonant frequency using a torsion spring. The wing is driven by a DC motor directly through gear transmission. Linear torsion springs mounted on the load shaft creates restoring torque when the wing is displaced from its mid-stroke position. The actuator dynamics is obtained using system identification. The flapping motion of the wing is achieved by closed-loop motor control, for example, tracking a sinusoidal wave with the frequency tuned to match the resonant frequency of the system. PID and LQR controllers are applied for instantaneous wing kinematics tracking: A PID controller is able to precisely track the trajectory with relatively large control input; on the other hand, a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) achieves large flapping amplitude with small input effort. We show that the mechanism is able to track sinusoidal motions with different amplitude, bias and frequencies with relatively large range by changing the springs, therefore generating roll and pitch torques that can be used for flight control. Then a Hopf oscillator based central pattern generator is also shown to be an alternative trajectory to track. The proposed wing actuation mechanism provides an at-scale wing testing platform for flapping wing micro aerial vehicles.},

abstract = {Scaling a flying robot down to the size of a fly or bee requires advances in manufacturing, sensing and control, and will provide insights into mechanisms used by their biological counterparts. Controlled flight at this scale has previously required external cameras to provide the feedback to regulate the continuous corrective manoeuvres necessary to keep the unstable robot from tumbling. One stabilization mechanism used by flying insects may be to sense the horizon or Sun using the ocelli, a set of three light sensors distinct from the compound eyes. Here, we present an ocelli-inspired visual sensor and use it to stabilize a fly-sized robot. We propose a feedback controller that applies torque in proportion to the angular velocity of the source of light estimated by the ocelli. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this is sufficient to stabilize the robot's upright orientation. This constitutes the first known use of onboard sensors at this scale. Dipteran flies use halteres to provide gyroscopic velocity feedback, but it is unknown how other insects such as honeybees stabilize flight without these sensory organs. Our results, using a vehicle of similar size and dynamics to the honeybee, suggest how the ocelli could serve this role.},

abstract = {The prominent maneuverability of flapping flight is enabled by rapid and significant changes in aerodynamic forces, which is a result of surprisingly subtle and precise changes of wing kinematics. The high sensitivity of aerodynamic forces to wing kinematic changes demands precise and instantaneous control of the flapping wing trajectories, especially in the presence of various types of uncertainties. In this work, we first present a dynamic model of a pair of direct-motor-driven flapping wings while taking into consideration the parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. We then present an Adaptive Robust Controller (ARC) to achieve robust performance of high-frequency (over 30Hz) instantaneous wing trajectory tracking with onboard feedback. The proposed control algorithm was experimentally validated on a 7.5 gram flapping-wing MAV which showed excellent tracking of various wing trajectories with different amplitude, bias, frequency, and split-cycles. Experimental results on various model wings demonstrated that the ARC can adapt to unknown parameters and show no performance degradation across wings of different geometries. The results of ARC were also compared with those of open-loop and classical PID controllers.},

abstract = {Flight speeds and behaviors of the sphinx moth Manduca sexta were recorded in chambers of four different sizes (0.57, 8.5, 44 and 447 m3). Mean horizontal speed increased linearly with the cube root of chamber volume from 0.57 m s-1 in the smallest chamber to 3.4 m s-1 in the largest. The maximum horizontal speed observed was 5.3 m s-1 in the largest chamber. Speeds decreased linearly with the logarithm of hawkmoth proximity to the wall. In a tunnel chamber (the third largest), moths often flew in a scalloped-shaped path. At the top of the scallop, they glided for 1{\&}shy;5 wing beats. In the largest chamber, moths could be recorded flying at angles other than horizontal (0 {\&}deg;). At flight angles greater or less than 0 {\&}deg;, mean speed decreased linearly with angle until {\&}plusmn;40 {\&}deg;. At greater angles, speeds remained between 1 and 2 m s-1. Moths also flew closer to the wall at flight angles deviating from the horizontal. An allometric analysis of the flight speeds of insects and birds suggests that M. sexta may be able to fly at 7{\&}shy;10 m s-1. We conclude that chamber size limits the flight speed and modifies the flight behavior of the tobacco hawkmoth.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of system identification (system ID) of a small fixed-wing low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system ID estimates the aerodynamic coefficients of the linear longitudinal equations of motion using batch least squares enhanced with an Error Filtering Online Learning (EFOL) scheme. EFOL estimates the state derivatives using filtering without taking the derivative, making the least squares more robust. Thus, this method of system ID only requires flight data of the states and not the state derivatives. This is advantageous due to the limitations of low-cost sensors including GPS-aided INS systems. The derivation and benefits of least squares with EFOL are briefly described here in. The main contribution of this paper is the identification of the aerodynamic force and moment coefficients for the linear longitudinal model of the UAV. The error between the flight data and the model response are also presented. The identified model shows good correlation to the training data. The model predicts well the short period flight characteristics of the fixed-wing UAV but does not fully capture the long period dynamics. Solutions to this issue are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {Research on bio-inspired flapping-wing micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) has experienced a steady growth over the past two decades. In particular, experiments on insect flight dynamics may provide new solutions for various challenges ranging from morphological design to force control mechanisms. A significant amount of research in this area is focused on modeling and simulation of such dynamics; however, mass of the wings and corresponding inertia effects are often ignored for simplification purposes. In this paper, the MAV is considered to be a structure with three rigid bodies, i.e., a main body and two wings. Wing strokes are limited within the body's transverse plane, though each wing can also passively pitch around its lateral axis. Using the Lagrangian, a dynamic multibody model of this system is developed to {\&}{\#}x226A;1{\&}{\#}x226B; analyze the significance of wing mass in flight dynamics and {\&}{\#}x226A;2{\&}{\#}x226B; simulate flight control experiments. The employed control approach is based on investigated relationships between mechanical impedance properties of the wing pitch joints and average values of aerodynamic forces. The results suggest that the wings' mass and mechanical impedance properties of the joints can be optimized together to enhance lift/thrust production. In addition, simulations of various flight maneuvers with the optimized model and proposed control approach always demonstrate an agile and stable behavior.},
